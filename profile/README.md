## 🎮 What’s the PEAK Cheat Scene All About?

PEAK cheats—via trainers or mod menus—are tools that mess with game memory directly, letting you do stuff like **unlimited stamina, speed boosts, teleport**, and more. Trainers modify live values like stamina or jump height, while others use mod menus like **PEAK AIO** with ImGui UI built on **BepInEx** .

Top hubs like VGTimes, FearlessRevolution, Thunderstore and UnknownCheats host these cheat files and menus .

## 💬 Reddit Insider Tip

From r/cheatengine:

> “Start off with 4 byte unknown initial value… search for decreased value… then increased… then unchanged… repeat until you find the stamina lock address.”
